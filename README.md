# 🧠 Digit Classification & Detection with PyTorch + OpenCV

This project combines deep learning and traditional computer vision to classify digits in natural scene images. It uses PyTorch to train a CNN on SVHN and CIFAR10, then leverages MSER (Maximally Stable Extremal Regions) from OpenCV to detect digits in real-world images.

### 📦 Features

    📚 Train and evaluate a custom CNN (MyModel) or VGG16 on SVHN + CIFAR10.

    🧪 Validation and testing loops with per-class accuracy and confusion matrix.

    🎯 Digit detection from raw images using OpenCV's MSER.

    🧠 Digit recognition via the trained model, overlaid on original images.

    💾 Save the best model based on validation accuracy.

```

### 🧪 Dataset Used
```
    SVHN (Street View House Numbers)

    CIFAR10 (only the "extra class" labeled as 10)

    Digits are from SVHN (0–9), and CIFAR10 is treated as class 10 to simulate out-of-domain distractors.
```

### ⚙️ Configuration

Modify the config_mymodel.yaml file to set parameters like:
```
train:
  batch_size: 64
  learning_rate: 0.001
  reg: 0.0005
  epochs: 10
  steps: [6, 8]
  warmup: 0
  momentum: 0.9
  model: MyModel   # or 'vgg16'
  train: True
```

📈 Training

To train the model (either MyModel or vgg16):
```bash
python main.py --config ./config_mymodel.yaml
```

🕵️‍♂️ Digit Detection on Real Images

After training (or loading a pre-trained model), the program detects and classifies digits from images using OpenCV:
```
python main.py --config ./config_mymodel.yaml
```
Detected digits will be drawn onto the images and saved into the images/ directory.

📌 Notes

    Make sure to modify MSER parameters (delta, min_area, max_area, distance) in main.py for best results on different images.

    Ensure your image dimensions and dataset align with what the model expects (32x32 RGB).

    find_digit() handles region proposal, cropping, transformation, and prediction.

🧠 Future Work

    Integrate CTC for sequence detection

    Replace MSER with a learnable region proposal network

    Expand with more datasets (e.g., MNIST, synthetic)
